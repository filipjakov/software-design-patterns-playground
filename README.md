# Software Design Patterns Playground and Analysis

Playing with various design patterns (mostly from GoF) using JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Structure

- The patterns are diveded into 3 categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral
- The folder structure will follow (this) pattern divide
- Each pattern will be placed in its own folder, containing:
  1. `index.ts` - starting point of the code example
  2. `README.md` - analyzis of the pattern
  3. `assets` folder

- There is the main `template.md` file which represents a template for the analyzis
